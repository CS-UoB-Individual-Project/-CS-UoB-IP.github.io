# Maths & CS

There are two different Maths & CS units:  
* 20 credit Year 3 **COMS30044 Individual Short Project**
* 40 credit Year 4 **COMSM0142 Individual Project with Presentation**

This page has information relevent to both units, as well as specific information about each one.

## Taking your project across TB4

Because of the different Maths unit options, some M&CS students will take your projects across Teaching Block 4 (across the full year - TB1+TB2=TB4). If you want to do this, you will need to:

* If you are planning to take the Project as TB4, please [email Mike and Sarah](/contact) so we are aware.
* When you are talking to a potential supervisor, make sure they are aware you are talking the project as TB4, so you will need to start your supervision in TB1.
* Get your project agreed with a supervisor in the first few weeks, so you can start work before Week 6 Reading Week.
* Make a strong project plan including working in TB1 (for example, if you are not taking any TB1 CS coursework units, you should plan to do significant work on your project in Weeks 9-11).
* If you are taking COMSM0142, you still need to attend the Presentation classes in TB2 and take that part of the assessment in Week 19.

## COMS30044: Individual Short Project

Because your unit is 20 credits, as opposed to 40 for everyone else, you are only expected to complete half the amount of work.  When you're talking to potential supervisors, please let them know you are taking the 20 credit project - and when you start your supervision in TB2 and meet your second marker at Poster Day and in the viva, rmind them too.  We will remind them as well, but it will make everyone's lives easier if there's no uncertainty.  

Apart from that, everything is the same - it's the same marking scheme, and you can choose from the same projects list - you'll just be completing less work.  There are examples of 20 credit projects in the [Class Materials folders](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-2024-5IndividualProjects2/Shared%20Documents/General?csf=1&web=1&e=s4hyuU) in 3 folders divided by grades the students achieved - look for the ones with names starting with COMS30044.  These can give you an idea of how much work is expected.  Because there are fewer students taking COMS30044, there are fewer example projects.  You can also look at the 40 credit projects to get inspiration, but bear in mind you are not expected to do this much work!

## COMSM0142: Individual Project with Presentation

Because the number of students who take this unit is small, there are not many examples of these projects in the [Class Materials folders](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-2024-5IndividualProjects2/Shared%20Documents/General?csf=1&web=1&e=s4hyuU).  However, the COMSM0052 projects are the Computer Science MEng students, and are equivalent amounts of work.  

### What is the presentation?

90% of your unit mark will be from your dissertation, with 10% coming from the presentation aspect.  

The presentation will be a 15-minute talk (with slides) given to a panel of markers and the other COMSM0142 students, with questions afterwards. These questions will not be deep and technical (as you might encounter in a viva), and you shouldn't need to spend any additional time preparing for them. 

You should aim your talk at the level of new year 3 students who are familiar with everything taught in year 1, who are *mostly* familiar with the mandatory units of year 2 but may need a refresher on harder concepts, and who know nothing about the year 3 units. Your goal is to communicate:

* What you're doing for your project and how it's going.
* Why you care about it, and why your audience should care as well.
* At least one idea from the technical side of your project that a new year 3 student would be unfamiliar with.

You do **not** need your talk to be an accurate overview of your project, as it will be submitted in March, and your mark will be independent of how well your wider project is going. (In fact, if a member of the marking panel is supervising your project, they'll recuse themselves from the discussion of your mark.) You're already being assessed on your project as a whole in the dissertation component. Here we're only concerned with your ability to effectively present to an audience on both technical and non-technical material, and your project is just a convenient topic to use for that.

Further details are discussed in the first workshop, linked below.

The marking panel will include Raphaël Clifford, Christian Konrad, John Lapinskas, and Michael Wray. A more formal description of the assessment along with a mark scheme is available [here](mark_scheme.pdf).

You should submit your slides in advance of the presentations themselves on Blackboard [here](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8033435_1&course_id=_257094_1&mode=reset) (scroll to the bottom). The deadline is the start of the presentations,
