# Maths & CS

There are two different Maths & CS units:  
* 20 credit Year 3 **COMS30044 Individual Short Project**
* 40 credit Year 4 **COMSM0142 Individual Project with Presentation**.

This page has information about both of the units, as well as specific information about each one.

## Taking your project across TB4

Because of the different Maths unit options, some M&CS students will take your projects across Teaching Block 4 (across the full year - TB1+TB2=TB4). If you want to do this, you will need to:

* If you are planning to take the Project as TB4, please [email Mike and Sarah](/contact)
* When you are talking to a potential supervisor, make sure they are aware you will want to take the project as TB4, so you will be starting your supervision in TB1.
* Get your project agreed with a supervisor in the first few weeks, so you can start work before Week 6 Reading Week.
* Make a strong project plan that means you will be working in TB1 (for example, if you are not taking any TB1 CS coursework units, you should plan to do significant work on your project in Weeks 9-11).
* If you are taking COMSM0142, you will still need to attend the Presentation classes in TB2 and take that part of the assessment at the same time.
