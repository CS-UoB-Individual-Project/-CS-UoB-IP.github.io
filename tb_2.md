# Teaching Block 2

During Teaching block 2 you will spend the majority of your time completing your project. There will be an additional Q&A session at the beginning of the second teaching block, but otherwise contact time will mostly be between you and your supervisor.

Other activities during this term will include:
* Writing Workshops
* Library Workshops
* Poster Workshops

As always, see the [schedule](/#schedule-videos-and-materials) for up-to-date information.


## Completing your Project

Your supervisor is expected to meet you for **at least 1 hour every 2 weeks** (or 0.5 hour every week) during teaching block 2.
This is a chance to ask questions and get guidance throughout the project, they will not solve your project for you, and there won't be time for them to do this. Do not expect more than a "let's discuss at the next meeting" as a response from your supervisor outside of your normal meeting time.

## Time Management

You should plan for 12 weeks with 40-hour work weeks for all your work in the Teaching Block - your project, your other unit(s) and the innovation case if in Year 4 - though with everything at University you can choose to break this up however you wish.
**You should not *plan* to work every day in TB2**, doing so will likely leave you falling behind.

Importantly, you should plan for *disruptions* which could be illnesses, job interviews, computer issues, etc.

## Minimum Viable Product

When planning your project you should define a minimum viable product(MVP). This should be enough to pass the unit that you will be able to **complete on time after around half of your alotted time** and should be discussed with your supervisor when confirming your project.

If your project is harder than expected, then you have the MVP to fall back on, otherwise you can add extra features to the MVP to increase the challenge of your project.

You should be constantly reviewing your progress during TB2, for yourself and for your supervisor. If you think you cannot finish the MVP **you should let your supervisor know immediately**.

## Mental Health

Your mental health is important, and the university will support you with it wherever it can.

Your main contacts for mental health support are:

* The Wellbeing Service, which you can contact at [wellbeing-access@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:wellbeing-access@bristol.ac.uk)
* Your GP, for example at the student health service.
* Other university services and resources, that you can find for example at [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing).

Your project supervisor and personal tutor can help you on the academic side, but they are not trained health professionals.

It is important not to overwork yourself, you will not do better work just by working longer hours, think of the project as a marathon - not a sprint.

If you notice your health (mental or physical) getting worse, or you are falling behind schedule, or you are worried that your thesis will not be complete on time, then you must speak to your project supervisor or Senior Tutor as soon as possible. If something has affected you before the Easter break, then we need to know before Easter; if something has been affecting you in previous years then you should mention it before you start your project.

## Project Poster Day

Every year in week 22 we hold the Project Poster day. This is a chance for you to present your work to the student body at the University. This will also be an opportunity to discuss your project with your second marker and get some feedback whilst you are currently writing up.

Whilst the poster day is optional, we **highly recommend you attend**, this is a chance to integrate outside feedback into your project and a chance to show off the incredible work that you have been doing.

## Writing your Dissertation

At the end of the project you will hand in your dissertation, which is a write-up of your project including how it fits into the literature, project execution, and results. **Only the dissertation and viva are marked**, so you may have completed an amazing project, but with a poor dissertation you can still fail the project.

We provide [templates](/assessment/#latex-dissertation-template) in LaTeX and Word for the dissertation for you to use, and **strongly recommend** the LaTeX template due to issues with Word and large files. If you want to use a different template (not recommended), get in contact with us as soon as possible as there are some formatting requirements - failure to follow these could result in failing the project unit.

# Assessment

Normally, you would submit your project in week 24. Submission consists of your dissertation (compulsory) and any auxiliary material (e.g. code), note that the submission is digital only.

Your project will be marked by your supervisor (known as the first marker) and a second marker who isn't involved with the project.
The second supervisor will be the one you meet at the Project Poster Day and will hold the viva with you.

## Marking Process

Both your markers will come up with mark suggestions independently. They will do so from reading the thesis and watching/conducting your viva.

Once both mark suggestions have been submitted, these will be shared and then both markers will agree on a final mark for the project.

At this stage, feedback for the project will be collated from both markers.

In the (very) rare case that both markers cannot agree on a final mark, a third backup marker will be brought in to contribute to the discussion.

## Viva (Oral Exam)

The second supervisor will hold your viva which for all purposes is an oral exam.
This means that **attendance is mandatory** and you will fail the unit if you are not present.

The viva has several purposes:
* To showcase parts of the project which cannot (easily) be incoporated into the dissertation.
* To get assurance that you have done the work yourself.
* To discuss any mistakes or omissions within the dissertation.
* To correct any misunderstandings the second marker may have had about the work.
* To explore your understanding of the project area.

The viva is not a separate marked component, rather it will factor into your final mark, though you can treat it as worth 5-10% of your overall mark.
 You should prepare for the viva, but there is no need to lose nights sleeping over it.
 In most cases, the viva clarifies and reinforces the second marker's initial impressions of the project rather than changing it completely.
