# Teaching Block 2

During Teaching block 2 you will spend the majority of your time completing your project. There will be an additional Q&A session at the beginning of the second teaching block, but otherwise contact time will mostly be between you and your supervisor.

Other activities during this term will include:
* Writing Workshops
* Library Workshops
* Poster Workshops

As always, see the [schedule](/#schedule-videos-and-materials) for up-to-date information.





## Project Poster Day

Every year in week 22 we hold the Project Poster day. This is a chance for you to present your work to the student body at the University. This will also be an opportunity to discuss your project with your second marker and get some feedback whilst you are currently writing up.

Whilst the poster day is optional, we **highly recommend you attend**, this is a chance to integrate outside feedback into your project and a chance to show off the incredible work that you have been doing.
