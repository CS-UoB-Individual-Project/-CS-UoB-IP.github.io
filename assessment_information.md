## Ethics

This year we will require **all** students to pass a short ethics quiz before
submitting their project specification, regardless of whether your project
requires an ethics application or not. In fact, the main point of the training 
is to make sure that you can accurately tell whether your project requires a full ethics
application or whether it's something that you and your supervisor can handle together.

### Ethics Quiz

*Coming soon!*

## Dissertation Writing

When writing your thesis, we **strongly** recommend writing it using Latex
unless you are confident writing a large document within microsoft word (or
equivalent). Large files in Word can cause formatting issues or crashes when
saving/loading the project file.

### General Purpose Guide to Academic Writing

Written by Dave Cliff, this gives some useful tips towards how to approach
academic-style writing and can be found [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/grp-cs-individual-projects-2022/Shared%20Documents/General/TipsOnWriting.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=SCyJhu).

### Latex Dissertation Template

folder you will also find a poster template for the project fair day.

### Word Dissertation Template
