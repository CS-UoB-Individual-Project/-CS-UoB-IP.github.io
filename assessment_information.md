## Assessment and Ethics Information

### Project Handbook

Almost every question you might have about the main dissertation is answered in
the project handbook, available [here](/handbook).

### Example Projects

We have selected a variety of student projects from last year covering a wide range of topics and have grouped them based on their mark. Make sure that you look at projects relevant to your unit code:

* Very High First (76+) [example projects](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/t/grp-cs-individual-projects-20232024/EtdmgghOx4ZLnQI_2RECzNYBxsSLESlMHcmMC71PqlG-nw?e=wucY3f)
* First class (70-75) [example projects](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/t/grp-cs-individual-projects-20232024/EkCMg6RcgFVKrfmgSw8LYFEBQpVJpd1ZKTTwvtpxgorjJw?e=S8WYSZ)
* High 2.i (65-68) [example projects](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/t/grp-cs-individual-projects-20232024/En3PgXfjzqVBuqv70JxezgcBzKBdCEXgVazcQwOhK8ikGA?e=QkWNij)

Note that these have been anonymised and some pages with identifying information has been removed.


## Ethics

This year we will require **all** students to pass a short ethics quiz before
submitting their project specification, regardless of whether your project
requires an ethics application or not. In fact, the main point of the training 
is to make sure that you can accurately tell whether your project requires a full ethics
application or whether it's something that you and your supervisor can handle together.

### Ethics Quiz

Can be found on the welcome page of your respective unit on blackboard.

### Ethics Links

* [Ethics Lecture](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/mw1760_bristol_ac_uk/EWWRhVq2SEVCpMz8B0Dna0IBdtjxdtG7zP0CKzpobZ3ALQ?e=wE4ED1) (useful to pass the ethics quiz!).

* [Student permission form](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/grp-cs-individual-projects-20232024/Class%20Materials/Student%20permission%20form.docx?d=w11808599cb264552aefb0e8301b12286&csf=1&web=1&e=tzCM0e) (for projects which need ethical approval and are
  covered by Ethics Application 0026).
  
* [Formal ethics applications](https://orems.bristol.ac.uk/ActivityForm/Index) (for projects which need ethical approval but are not
  covered by Ethics Application 0026).  Before you put your application in, read the [Faculty Research Ethics Committee webpage](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/engineering/SitePages/research-ethics-committee.aspx).  The deadline for being considered at the February Committee is 18 January 2024, with a clinic to support applications on 17 January.  If you are planning to put in an application, we strongly recommend you reach out to Faculty Research Ethics Administrator, Marc Moyce at marc.moyce@bristol.ac.uk, to get advice on your application - ideally in TB1.
  
* [Sample Consent form template](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/grp-cs-individual-projects-20232024/Class%20Materials/Consent%20form%20template.docx?d=w96be1235d3714a069cab90d38c594ff9&csf=1&web=1&e=4BPSEX).

## Dissertation Writing

When writing your thesis, we **strongly** recommend writing it using Latex
unless you are confident writing a large document within microsoft word (or
equivalent). Large files in Word can cause formatting issues or crashes when
saving/loading the project file.

### General Purpose Guide to Academic Writing

academic-style writing and can be found [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/grp-cs-individual-projects-20232024/Class%20Materials/TipsOnWriting.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=eg9oHo).
