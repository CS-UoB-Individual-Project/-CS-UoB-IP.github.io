## Assessment Information

### Project Handbook

Almost every question you might have about the main dissertation is answered in
the project handbook, available [here](/handbook).

### Example Projects

We have selected a variety of student projects from last year covering a wide range of topics and have grouped them based on their mark. Make sure that you look at projects relevant to your unit code:

* Very High First (76+) [example projects](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/t/grp-cs-individual-projects-20232024/EtdmgghOx4ZLnQI_2RECzNYBxsSLESlMHcmMC71PqlG-nw?e=wucY3f)
* First class (70-75) [example projects](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/t/grp-cs-individual-projects-20232024/EkCMg6RcgFVKrfmgSw8LYFEBQpVJpd1ZKTTwvtpxgorjJw?e=S8WYSZ)
* High 2.i (65-68) [example projects](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/t/grp-cs-individual-projects-20232024/En3PgXfjzqVBuqv70JxezgcBzKBdCEXgVazcQwOhK8ikGA?e=QkWNij)

Note that these have been anonymised and some pages with identifying information has been removed.


## Dissertation Writing

When writing your thesis, we **strongly** recommend writing it using Latex
unless you are confident writing a large document within microsoft word (or
equivalent). Large files in Word can cause formatting issues or crashes when
saving/loading the project file.
