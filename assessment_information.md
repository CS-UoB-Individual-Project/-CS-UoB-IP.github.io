## Assessment and Ethics Information

### Project Handbook

Almost every question you might have about the main dissertation is answered in
the project handbook, available [here](../2022_23_Project_handbook.pdf).

### Example Projects

Coming soon!


## Ethics

This year we will require **all** students to pass a short ethics quiz before
submitting their project specification, regardless of whether your project
requires an ethics application or not. In fact, the main point of the training 
is to make sure that you can accurately tell whether your project requires a full ethics
application or whether it's something that you and your supervisor can handle together.

### Ethics Quiz

Can be found on the welcome page of your respective unit on blackboard.

Links are here for [COMS30044](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/launchAssessment.jsp?course_id=_252952_1&content_id=_7383656_1&mode=cpview), [COMS30045](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/launchAssessment.jsp?course_id=_252951_1&content_id=_7382043_1&mode=cpview), and [COMSM0052](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/launchAssessment.jsp?course_id=_252905_1&content_id=_7383655_1&mode=cpview)

## Dissertation Writing

When writing your thesis, we **strongly** recommend writing it using Latex
unless you are confident writing a large document within microsoft word (or
equivalent). Large files in Word can cause formatting issues or crashes when
saving/loading the project file.
