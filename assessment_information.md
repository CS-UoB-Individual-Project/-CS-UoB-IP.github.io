  covered by Ethics Application 97842).

## Dissertation Writing

When writing your thesis, we **strongly** recommend writing it using Latex
unless you are confident writing a large document within microsoft word (or
equivalent). Large files in Word can cause formatting issues or crashes when
saving/loading the project file.

academic-style writing and can be found [here]().
