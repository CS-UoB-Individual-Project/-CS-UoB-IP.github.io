# Academic Integrity and Plagiarism

We expect all final year students to be familiar with and correctly follow the university's rules on academic integrity and plagiarism.  Please read the [University pages on Academic Integrity](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/), including the 3 linked pages on [plagiarism](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/plagiarism/), [collusion](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/collusion/) and [contract cheating, including 'AI' tools](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/contract-cheating/).

You are expected to complete online academic integrity training - find this on the [Academic Integrity: School of Computer Science 2023](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8261184_1&course_id=_258488_1) site on Blackboard.

**Plagiarism is an offence** and can lead to a punishment even if you were unfamiliar with the rules or made an honest mistake.

We will check for academic integrity and plagiarism in three ways:
1. We run all dissertations through TurnItIn to check that work submitted is your own or correctly referenced.
2. Your supervisor (who is your first marker) is the subject expert and will know text that is not correctly referenced.
3. If you cannot explain basic parts of your dissertation within the viva then you are likely to be investigated further.


# TurnItIn

We use TurnItIn to check for plagiarism and AI usage.  When you submit your
dissertation, you will be able to see a TurnItIn report giving a similarity
measure to other sources online and submitted in previous years.  **NOTE** You
should not look at the similarity score by itself, instead look to make sure
that large portions of your text do not overlap without proper
quoting/citation.  If you have any questions about similarity score, talk to
your supervisor and they can advise you.

# Translation tools
As per university policy, it is against policy to write in your native language
and translate to English using a tool (whether it is AI or not).  The degree
program is in English and so we expect students to write their dissertation in
English.  Translating your dissertation into English using a tool is Academic
Misconduct and can see severe penalties to your degree classification and
progress.

# 'AI' tools

The Faculty position is that if you use 'AI' tools (such as ChatGPT, Claude, CoPilot, DeepL and other translation tools, the paid subscription to Gramamrly etc), you should cite all uses in your report.  The full information is in the single page [Faculty guidance](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-8241705-dt-content-rid-48627612_3/xid-48627612_3), which you should read (you must be signed into Blackboard to access it, and can also access it if you scroll down to Academic Integrity in the Blackboard [CS student handbook](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8241665_1&course_id=_258444_1&content_id=_8241705_1#).

If you're interested in the University policies on 'AI' tools and the reasoning behind them, including some of the risks, read the new [Study Skills Resource](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-8037204-dt-content-rid-46594374_2/courses/Study_Skills/using-ai-at-university/index.html).
