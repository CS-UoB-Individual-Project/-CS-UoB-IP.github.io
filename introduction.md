This page will contain a high-level overview of the individual project unit.
We recommend reading this and the following pages in detail:

3. [Assessment Information](assessment)


# Principles and Independent Learning Objectives (ILOs)

You should bear in mind the following three principles whilst completing your project:
1. You will be performing **self-directed, independent work**. You are responsible for every part of the project from planning, execution and submission. It is _your_ project.
2. You will be working on an **in-depth, challenging project**. Your supervisor will ensure that the project is appropriate and relevant.
3. You will need to demonstrate the ILOs which have been designed to match graduate Computer Science Jobs:
  * Demonstrate understanding of research-level material
  * Identify a well-motivated, scientifically interesting challenge.
  * Engage in a suitable approach to solving said challenge.
  * Critically evaluate your solution in a suitable manner.
  * Present your results in written and verbal form.
  * Manage your own time, and decide your own objectives. 

# Overall Timeline

The projects unit will run in three phases:
* **TB1** You will find a supervisor and *specify* a project.
* **TB2** You will *execute* your project and write up a *dissertation*.
* **Summer Assessment Period** We will *assess* your project by reading the dissertation and holding an oral exam (viva).

You can find a full up to date list of the schedule of the unit on the [main hub](/#schedule-videos-and-materials)

# Academic Integrity and Plagiarism

We expect all final year students to be familiar with and correctly follow the university's rules on academic integrity and plagiarism.  Please read the [University pages on Academic Integrity](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/), including the 3 linked pages on [plagiarism](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/plagiarism/), [collusion](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/collusion/) and [contract cheating, including 'AI' tools](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/contract-cheating/).

You are expected to complete online academic integrity training - find this on the [Academic Integrity: School of Computer Science 2023](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8261184_1&course_id=_258488_1) site on Blackboard.

**Plagiarism is an offence** and can lead to a punishment even if you were unfamiliar with the rules or made an honest mistake.

We will check for academic integrity and plagiarism in three ways:
1. We run all dissertations through TurnItIn to check that work submitted is your own or correctly referenced.
2. Your supervisor (who is your first marker) is the subject expert and will know text that is not correctly referenced.
3. . If you cannot explain basic parts of your dissertation within the viva then you are likely to be investigated further.


## A note on AI within Submissions

The Faculty position is that if you use 'AI' tools (such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, DeepL translation tools etc, you should cite all uses in your report.  The full information is in the single page [Faculty guidance](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-8241705-dt-content-rid-48627612_3/xid-48627612_3), which you should read (you must be signed into Blackboard to access it, and can also access it if you scroll down to Academic Integrity in the Blackboard [CS student handbook](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8241665_1&course_id=_258444_1&content_id=_8241705_1#).

If you're interested in the University policies on 'AI' tools and the reasoning behind them, including some of the risks, read the new [Study Skills Resource](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-8037204-dt-content-rid-46594374_2/courses/Study_Skills/using-ai-at-university/index.html). 


# The Innovation Case

This section only concerns students on the 4 year degree programmes (COMSM0052 and COMSM0142), all other students can stop reading now!

If you are on the MEng degree, you will submit an innovation case (worth 5 CP) if you are on COMSM0052 or perform an oral presentation (worth 4CP of the unit).

Regardless of the format, these supplemental assessments are designed to understand and express how your skills and knowledge can make a positive and valuable difference in the world.
You will develop an argument for the relevance and significance of Computer Science work in your research project area for an external audience.
You will have separate sessions within your timetable which will guide you through the process and how to present your work in such a style.
