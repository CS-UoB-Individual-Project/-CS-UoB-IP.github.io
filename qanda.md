# Individual Project Handbook - Questions & Answers

## How to use this handbook
This year we've made the decision to split the handbook in two. This page will contain detailed questions and answers regarding the unit listed alphabetically by topic. We **do not** suggest reading this in full, rather use the search function of the website to find out what you need.

The other half of the unit handbook can be found on the [Handbook tab](/handbook/) and contains the quick-start guide which gives a high-level overview of the individual project unit. We recommend that you **read this in detail** and refer back to this over the year.

### Choosing a Supervisor

* **How do I choose a supervisor?**: You should choose your supervisor based on the area of the project you want to work on as well as someone that you are interested in working with. During TB1 we will release a spreadsheet containing a list of projects that each supervisor is interested in supervising, but note that this is not a non-exhaustive list!
* **What are Supervisor slots?**: Each year supervisors are allotted a certain number of projects that thy have to supervise. Most supervisors will refuse to take on any more students if they have already filled up their allotment - which they are perfectly allowed to do.

### Contacting your Supervisor

* **I cannot contact my supervisor**: Please wait 3 working days after sending an email to your supervisor before sending another email. If after another 3 working days you have had no reply, please email the Unit Director and/or Deputy Unit Directors on the [Contact Us](/contact/) page.
* **My supervisor refuses to meet me**: Please email the Unit Director and/or Deputy Unit Directors on the [Contact Us](/contact/) page including any recent and relevant emails with your supervisor.
