## Viva Dates

Most vivas will be held on the 11th and 12th May in Bristol. Treat these dates as an exam, i.e. you should be free for these dates.  Because of staff availability, a small number of vivas will be held outside these dates, so **you MUST be in Bristol for the full summer assessment period, 28th April to 16th May 2025**.

Note that vivas are being planned to be **in-person**.
