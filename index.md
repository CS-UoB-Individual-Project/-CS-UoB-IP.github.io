## Welcome

Welcome to the project unit! Your final project is the pinnacle of your degree.
It is a chance for you to demonstrate what you have learnt and what you are
capable of. It makes up a significant part of your degree classification. It
will be challenging, and you will need to demonstrate that you can overcome
this challenge. That said, it will also be one of the most fulfilling parts of
your degree, since it is a chance to focus on what you want to do, supported by
one-on-one sessions with experts in the field.

## Viva Dates

Most vivas will be held on the **** in Bristol. Treat these dates as an exam, i.e. you should be free for these dates.  Because of staff availability, a small number of vivas will be held outside these dates, so you MUST be in Bristol for the full summer assessment period, 28th April to 16th May 2025.

Note that vivas are being planned to be **in-person**.

## Equipment, Software and Subscriptions for your Project

**DO NOT SPEND YOUR OWN MONEY ON YOUR PROJECT!!**
We have a budget that we can use to buy you equipment, software, subscriptions, websites and more (within reason) but it is very hard for us to reimburse students money that you have spent.  

There is information on the [Accessing Equipment/Software](/money) page about how you can borrow, buy and use things for your project.  

## Project Code for Blue Crystal

When submittng jobs for Blue Crystal, ACRC requires you to use a project code. Under project details, make sure you click join an existing project, with the Final Year Projects project code: **COMS031144**, not any other codes you may have been given for previous units.
