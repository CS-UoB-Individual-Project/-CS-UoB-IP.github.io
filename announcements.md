## Project Specification Spreadsheet Released

Hi all,

The spreadsheet of supervisors and project ideas is here (finally). It’s available [here](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/fz19826_bristol_ac_uk/ESYKQgOA6MdCsfNr39lHq3EBKwArGEpOKmuXcMnjjfT3sQ) or on the unit page - **you’ll need to open it in Excel desktop, then agree to the warning about external connections**.

The project specification form is available [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG1XIgcXxY4VKmVom51Cg1JBUQzhDVVRYTEhKQkFaSlNNNVAzVjJIUFU1Ti4u) or on the unit page, but before filling it out you’ll need to watch the ethics training and pass the quiz also now available on the unit page or on the welcome page on Blackboard. As a reminder, the quiz is modelled on workplace training - you can take it as many times as you like, but you need to pass it on Blackboard to proceed to the project (telling your friends the password to the form will not work). 

What you need to do now is:
1. Take a look at the “supervisor interests” section of the spreadsheet to find a shortlist of supervisors interested in the general area you want to work in.
2. Take a look at the “suggested projects” section of the spreadsheet to look up those supervisors, see their particular interests and supervision style, read the ideas they’re putting out there, and pick someone you want to work with.
3. Send them an email! (See the intro talk for more details on how to approach people and what to expect.)
4. Discuss the project with them and come to an agreement (maybe repeating steps 1-3 a few times if there’s a flurry of early activity).
5. Set up a meeting with your supervisor at the start of TB2 so you can hit the ground running.
6. Do the mandatory ethics training. Each correct answer on the quiz has one character in the feedback on Blackboard. By putting these characters together, ordered by question number, you’ll obtain a passcode.
7. Using this passcode, submit a project specification to the system and get an email from MarkerBot confirming receipt.
8. They sign off on the specification, you get another email from MarkerBot to say so **and now you’re done for this unit in TB1**!

**Warning**: steps 3 and 4 are not optional - if you submit a project specification for a supervisor without talking to them first, they’ll definitely turn it down!

Also, as a reminder: next Wednesday afternoon (**October 25th**) from **2pm-4pm** we’re running a project matching session in Bill Brown. We **strongly** recommend you come if you don’t have a project signed off by next Wednesday.

Kind Regards,

Mike and Sarah


## Start of TB1 Video Released

Hi All,

Just to mention that the start of TB1 video has been released at [this link]() (you can also find this on the home page under the introductory talk). If you have any questions, please put them in the padlet for the first Q&A session [here](https://uob.padlet.org/michaelwray1/individual-projects-23-24-q-a-1-hpsbiporpnr7eezo).

Later this week we will have a new list of example projects from last year spanning different units and areas for you to draw some inspiration from.

Hope the start of term goes well!

Thanks,

Mike and Sarah
