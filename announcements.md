## TB2 Talk Live, Q&A Session, and Library Skills Workshop Next Week

Hi All,

We hope you had a good Christmas break/New Year and your exams went well. You can now find the start of TB2 task online [here](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/mw1760_bristol_ac_uk/EdIpeT0j8EJCv82wVcju0_oBs0wbX9FNW-kKWEcl8RE8eA?e=K8KpCN), it will give a brief overview of what's happening this term. As mentioned in the video, now is the time to ask your supervisor for a meeting to start discussing and beginning your project.

We have an online Q&A session next week in case you have any questions about this term. This will run the same as last term on Padlet, which you can find [here](https://uob.padlet.org/michaelwray1/t6o997uy3f7wriem).

Additionally, next Wednesday (1st February 15:00 in Pugsley LT, Queens) we will have Victoria Hopton from the Library Services to give a workshop on best practices to find and reference related works within the literature which will be beneficial both starting your project and writing up.

Kind Regards,

Mike

## Reminder: Project matching day Wednesday!

Hi all,

This is a reminder that the project matching day is going to happen **this Wednesday** in the **Bill Brown Suite** (Queen's Building) from **2pm-4pm**. This is a general mingling event between students who need supervisors and supervisors who need students - so if you haven't been able to find a supervisor in your area yet, or if you're still not quite sure what you'd like to do, this is a great opportunity! (As a corollary, if you've already found a supervisor then there's no need to come.) If you're coming, it would be a good idea to take another look at [the spreadsheet](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/fz19826_bristol_ac_uk/EWPVy8ttUt9EqjSR97u8B0wBZRkOmt8oJXYPeyX9mAHKkA) beforehand, to get an idea of who you might want to talk to.

Best wishes,

John

## Project ideas are live!

Hi all,

The vaunted spreadsheet of supervisors and project ideas is finally here! It's available [here](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/fz19826_bristol_ac_uk/EWPVy8ttUt9EqjSR97u8B0wBZRkOmt8oJXYPeyX9mAHKkA) or on the unit page - you'll need to open it in Excel desktop, then agree to the warning about external connections. The project specification form is available [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG1XIgcXxY4VKmVom51Cg1JBUQzhDVVRYTEhKQkFaSlNNNVAzVjJIUFU1Ti4u) or on the unit page, but before filling it out you'll need to watch the ethics training and pass the quiz also now available on the unit page (with different links depending on your unit). As a reminder, the quiz is modelled on workplace training - you can take it as many times as you like, but you need to pass it in order to proceed to the project. 

What you need to do now is:

1. Take a look at the "supervisor interests" section of the spreadsheet to find a shortlist of supervisors interested in the general area you want to work in.
2. Take a look at the "suggested projects" section of the spreadsheet to look up those supervisors, see their particular interests and supervision style, read the ideas they're putting out there, and pick someone you want to work with.
3. Send them an email! (See the intro talk for more details on how to approach people and what to expect.)
4. Discuss the project with them and come to an agreement (maybe repeating steps 1-3 a few times if there's a flurry of early activity).
5. Do the mandatory ethics training. Each correct answer on the quiz has one character in the feedback on Blackboard. By putting these characters together, ordered by question number, you'll obtain a passcode.
6. Using this passcode, submit a project specification to the system and get an email from MarkerBot confirming receipt.
7. They sign off on the specification, you get another email from MarkerBot to say so, and now you're done for this unit in TB1!

**Warning:** steps 3 and 4 are not optional - if you submit a project specification for a supervisor without talking to them first, they'll definitely turn it down!

Also, as a reminder: next Wednesday afternoon (**October 26th**) from **2pm-4pm** we're running a project matching session in Bill Brown. There's no need to come along if you have a supervisor or you're already in talks with someone, but if you're having a hard time finding someone or you're not quite sure what you want to do, then this is a great chance to meet people - most of the available supervisors will be there!

Best wishes,

John

## Welcome, week 2+3 Q&As are **online**!

Hi all,

Welcome to the project unit! This year we're hosting all three units on a common GitHub Pages site [here](http://cs-uob-individual-project.github.io/), to avoid having three separate pages that slowly fall out of sync with each other - you'll still submit work via the Blackboard page, but otherwise it's just a link to the main site. We've also got a common unit team, grp-cs-individual-projects-2022, which you should have been added to - if not, get in touch with us by email. We've released a start-of-TB1 video on the unit page that everyone should watch - it covers the process of coming up with a project idea and finding a supervisor, which you will be doing this teaching block (not TB2) - as well as a handbook with more details on the rest of the unit. We'll run Q&A sessions based in the unit team in weeks 2 and 3, and the full supervisor-finding process will start in week 4. In general, by the time week 4 hits you should aim to already have a good idea of what you want to do in your project.

Importantly, **there is a timetable error for the Q&A sessions in weeks 2 and 3.** They are listed in your calendars as taking place in-person in Physics, but **they will take place online in the unit Team**.

Best wishes,

John
