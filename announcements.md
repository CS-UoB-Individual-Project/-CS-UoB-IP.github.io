# Announcements Page

## Welcome, week 2+3 Q&As are **online**!

Hi all,

Welcome to the project unit! This year we're hosting all three units on a common GitHub Pages site [here](https://github.com/CS-UoB-Individual-Project), to avoid having three separate pages that slowly fall out of sync with each other - you'll still submit work via the Blackboard page, but otherwise it's just a link to the main site. We've also got a common unit team, grp-cs-individual-projects-2022, which you should have been added to - if not, get in touch with us by email. We've released a start-of-TB1 video on the unit page that everyone should watch - it covers the process of coming up with a project idea and finding a supervisor, which you will be doing this teaching block (not TB2) - as well as a handbook with more details on the rest of the unit. We'll run Q&A sessions based in the unit team in weeks 2 and 3, and the full supervisor-finding process will start in week 4. In general, by the time week 4 hits you should aim to already have a good idea of what you want to do in your project.

Importantly, **there is a timetable error for the Q&A sessions in weeks 2 and 3.** They are listed in your calendars as taking place in-person in Physics, but **they will take place online in the unit Team**.

Best wishes,

John
