## LaTeX introduction and writing workshops signup (deadline this Thursday!)

Hi all,

Now that you're starting to think about your dissertations (and posters!) I've finished recording a fairly comprehensive introduction to LaTeX via Overleaf, now available [here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/ff83cc49-acd5-4ca1-b1b2-b01576f2e0ed). I know it's a long video, but even if you've worked with LaTeX before and picked some of it up already, it's worth having this on double speed in the background - I go into a lot of stuff that you would normally only find out through bitter and painful experience like how to stop the " and € characters rendering poorly, how to stop macros eating spaces, how to do code listings easily (tl;dr use minted!), and the counterintuitive role of "and" in BiBTeX, as well as more basic stuff like when and how to use \labels and \refs and macros. Also, the last half of the video is only relevant to people are using LaTeX's extensive maths typesetting capabilities, so for everyone else it's a svelte and minimalistic one hour video. ;-)

The other important dissertation-related announcement is that signups are now open for the optional **writing workshops** run by the Centre for Academic Language Development (CALD). We did these last year and the student feedback was very positive despite them being online-only - this year they're back in-person so they'll definitely be worth going to! The first one is next week, and will focus on both the high level (how to structure and plan a 30-50 page piece of technical writing) and on the low level (how to write technical content in a readable way). The second one is set for the week after the spring vacation, by which point you should have made a start on your dissertation, and is an opportunity for structured peer feedback - getting feedback on your drafts from other students and discussing what works well and what doesn't. (Note that everyone is entitled to feedback on a small section from their supervisor as well, as well as having a chance to meet your second marker at the poster day and chat about what they'll be looking for - this is peer feedback _in addition_ to academic feedback, not as a substitute for it!) The workshops will be run as small groups across several different time slots - this does mean we won't be able to have unit staff there, since too many sessions will be happening in parallel, but the content is well-tailored to the unit despite that. You can sign up [here](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG14OckdYwkZEgG8T9IEI_AJUN05NRlFEMzU1UldZMUUyUlhBODUzVDhPQiQlQCNjPTEkJUAjdD1n), but note that **the signup deadline is this Thursday** to give CALD time to assign people to sessions and time slots in a sensible way.

Best wishes,

John

## Poster Fair Details - 19th April 2023

Hi all,
 
For the first time in 3 years(!), the department is once again organising an in-person version of the final year CS BSc and MEng students’ Project Fair which will take place on **Wednesday 19th April 2023 from 2pm in Bill Brown Design Suite**. You will informally **present your work as a poster** describing your project and results so far to markers and other interested students.  You can expect to meet your marker for around 10 minutes, including questions and discussion of your project so far. This year we are happy to have industrial partners also attending the poster day to discuss your projects with. This will be a valuable tool to get an outsider’s perspective on your project as well as giving you the opportunity to learn more about Computer Science after your degree.

Posters are not mandatory, but **most students are expected to take part** and the poster presentations are a **perfect opportunity for you to get feedback** and give a first glimpse of your project to your 2nd marker. As your project is still ongoing, some of your results and achievements may be tentative or forthcoming: this is fine and expected.

**What you need to do if you plan to present your work:**

* Prepare an A1 Poster to facilitate your discussion with your second marker (see below for templates and guidelines)
	
* Submit your poster to get printed by Thursday 30th March at 12pm. You will find a new submission point on the blackboard page for your unit which is titled Poster Fair Poster Submission, you can submit your poster here (you have unlimited attempts, but we will use whatever your latest attempt is once the deadline has passed).
	
* Make sure your poster is in pdf and the correct size - you may need to check images to ensure that they print well at A1 sizes by printing parts of the pdf at A4/A3 at A1 resolution.

**Poster specifics:**

* You can find information on how to create a poster [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/grp-cs-individual-projects-2022/Shared%20Documents/General/Poster%20examples/Poster%20info%20and%20hyperlinks.docx?d=w30d671ef61644c08aa05c3ba39f962f8&csf=1&web=1&e=eGIFU7&xsdata=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%3D&sdata=NGxCeDNNSkhMYVBkUjZaWVlLMVhCQ2xaTFlhdDhKcFo1OStiZGRibkNlQT0%3D&isSPOFile=1).

* Note it’s hard to give specific advice for every project as depending on the topic the poster style can vary a lot (compare a theory poster to a computer vision poster!).
	
* Thankfully, we have asked members of the department to give example posters and you can find them all [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-cs-individual-projects-2022/Shared%20Documents/General/Poster%20examples?csf=1&web=1&e=treaBQ&xsdata=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%3D&sdata=cW1EMFk4ZFVYS002UW9mNDMyN2dIOW9lYUU5U2dtWG5mRGNLSDIrcjZvZz0%3D). Feel free to peruse them all and find a style which you think matches you and your project, poster making is often a subjective art!

**Demos:** If you need to demo an aspect of your project and will need suitable space/power etc. we will be sending out a form closer to the project fair that you can fill in asking for demo space. We can only assign extra space for a small number of projects, so we will be assigning these to those who will need these requirements to show their project off. As an example, if you are doing a deep learning project, asking for demo space will not be granted, but if you have made a robot as part of the project then we will work to give you the space to demo it!

**PSA: An Update on Ethics for Self Recording**

We have had an update from the ethics board regarding self evaluation here, but in essence this means that for vision projects, if you are recording yourself (and only yourself!) as a source of training data then you do not need a formal ethics application with some caveats (i.e. if you're recording invasive information then you will need ethics). If you have any questions or are unsure how this may fit into your project, please ask your supervisor! It’s a lot of trouble for you (and a lot of work for us) if a project that should have had ethics and didn’t get it.

Thanks,

Mike, John, and Sarah

## New policy for project expenses (don't email sceem-manager@bristol.ac.uk)

Hi all,

I've just been told that there's a new policy on project expenses this year. The amount of money available is still the same, but rather than emailing the school manager you should instead go via the process described on the Tech Services site [here](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_7446252_1&course_id=_238502_1) (Blackboard link, login required). Our teaching technologist is Luke Woodbury, and when contacting him you should cc me (and your supervisor) so I can OK the spending. I understand the school manager email has been quite slow in responding to students - I'm sorry for the resulting delay to people's projects.

Best wishes,

John

## Blue Crystal 4 Project Code

Hi All,

For those who are using (or thinking of using) Blue Crystal phase 4 for their project, please be aware that since last Thursday, you now require a project code to submit jobs. You may have been given a project code from a previous unit, but please ensure that you use the project code that has been set up purely for Computer Science Final Year Projects: **COSC027924**.

Thanks,

Mike

## TB2 Talk Live, Q&A Session, and Library Skills Workshop Next Week

Hi All,

We hope you had a good Christmas break/New Year and your exams went well. You can now find the start of TB2 task online [here](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/mw1760_bristol_ac_uk/EdIpeT0j8EJCv82wVcju0_oBs0wbX9FNW-kKWEcl8RE8eA?e=K8KpCN), it will give a brief overview of what's happening this term. As mentioned in the video, now is the time to ask your supervisor for a meeting to start discussing and beginning your project.

We have an online Q&A session next week in case you have any questions about this term. This will run the same as last term on Padlet, which you can find [here](https://uob.padlet.org/michaelwray1/t6o997uy3f7wriem).

Additionally, next Wednesday (1st February 15:00 in Pugsley LT, Queens) we will have Victoria Hopton from the Library Services to give a workshop on best practices to find and reference related works within the literature which will be beneficial both starting your project and writing up.

Kind Regards,

Mike

## Reminder: Project matching day Wednesday!

Hi all,

This is a reminder that the project matching day is going to happen **this Wednesday** in the **Bill Brown Suite** (Queen's Building) from **2pm-4pm**. This is a general mingling event between students who need supervisors and supervisors who need students - so if you haven't been able to find a supervisor in your area yet, or if you're still not quite sure what you'd like to do, this is a great opportunity! (As a corollary, if you've already found a supervisor then there's no need to come.) If you're coming, it would be a good idea to take another look at [the spreadsheet](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/fz19826_bristol_ac_uk/EWPVy8ttUt9EqjSR97u8B0wBZRkOmt8oJXYPeyX9mAHKkA) beforehand, to get an idea of who you might want to talk to.

Best wishes,

John

## Project ideas are live!

Hi all,

The vaunted spreadsheet of supervisors and project ideas is finally here! It's available [here](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/fz19826_bristol_ac_uk/EWPVy8ttUt9EqjSR97u8B0wBZRkOmt8oJXYPeyX9mAHKkA) or on the unit page - you'll need to open it in Excel desktop, then agree to the warning about external connections. The project specification form is available [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG1XIgcXxY4VKmVom51Cg1JBUQzhDVVRYTEhKQkFaSlNNNVAzVjJIUFU1Ti4u) or on the unit page, but before filling it out you'll need to watch the ethics training and pass the quiz also now available on the unit page (with different links depending on your unit). As a reminder, the quiz is modelled on workplace training - you can take it as many times as you like, but you need to pass it in order to proceed to the project. 

What you need to do now is:

1. Take a look at the "supervisor interests" section of the spreadsheet to find a shortlist of supervisors interested in the general area you want to work in.
2. Take a look at the "suggested projects" section of the spreadsheet to look up those supervisors, see their particular interests and supervision style, read the ideas they're putting out there, and pick someone you want to work with.
3. Send them an email! (See the intro talk for more details on how to approach people and what to expect.)
4. Discuss the project with them and come to an agreement (maybe repeating steps 1-3 a few times if there's a flurry of early activity).
5. Do the mandatory ethics training. Each correct answer on the quiz has one character in the feedback on Blackboard. By putting these characters together, ordered by question number, you'll obtain a passcode.
6. Using this passcode, submit a project specification to the system and get an email from MarkerBot confirming receipt.
7. They sign off on the specification, you get another email from MarkerBot to say so, and now you're done for this unit in TB1!

**Warning:** steps 3 and 4 are not optional - if you submit a project specification for a supervisor without talking to them first, they'll definitely turn it down!

Also, as a reminder: next Wednesday afternoon (**October 26th**) from **2pm-4pm** we're running a project matching session in Bill Brown. There's no need to come along if you have a supervisor or you're already in talks with someone, but if you're having a hard time finding someone or you're not quite sure what you want to do, then this is a great chance to meet people - most of the available supervisors will be there!

Best wishes,

John

## Welcome, week 2+3 Q&As are **online**!

Hi all,

Welcome to the project unit! This year we're hosting all three units on a common GitHub Pages site [here](http://cs-uob-individual-project.github.io/), to avoid having three separate pages that slowly fall out of sync with each other - you'll still submit work via the Blackboard page, but otherwise it's just a link to the main site. We've also got a common unit team, grp-cs-individual-projects-2022, which you should have been added to - if not, get in touch with us by email. We've released a start-of-TB1 video on the unit page that everyone should watch - it covers the process of coming up with a project idea and finding a supervisor, which you will be doing this teaching block (not TB2) - as well as a handbook with more details on the rest of the unit. We'll run Q&A sessions based in the unit team in weeks 2 and 3, and the full supervisor-finding process will start in week 4. In general, by the time week 4 hits you should aim to already have a good idea of what you want to do in your project.

Importantly, **there is a timetable error for the Q&A sessions in weeks 2 and 3.** They are listed in your calendars as taking place in-person in Physics, but **they will take place online in the unit Team**.

Best wishes,

John
