# Ethics

This year we will require **all** students to pass a short ethics quiz before
submitting their project specification, regardless of whether your project
requires an ethics application or not. In fact, the main point of the training
is to make sure that you can accurately tell whether your project requires a
full ethics application or whether it's something that you and your supervisor
can handle together.

## Ethics Quiz

Can be found on the welcome page of your respective unit on blackboard.

## Ethics Statement

**All projects will need an ethics statement** at the beginning of the dissertation, and all projects will fall into one of three categories:

1. Projects that do not require ethical approval because they do not collect or process any relevant data.
2. Projects that can be reviewed by your supervisor under "Ethics Appliction 0026", because they are judged to be low ethical risk.
3. Projects that require full ethical review by the Faculty Research Ethics Committee (FREC).

We will provide ethical training with a mandatory test to ensure that you've understood what is permitted under each of the above categories.
The test allows multiple attempts and was released in TB1 alongside the training.


## Formal Ethics Application

Before you put your application in, read the [Faculty Research Ethics Committee
webpage](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/engineering/SitePages/research-ethics-committee.aspx).
The deadline for being considered at the February Committee has now passsed,
but applications will now be considered on a rolling basis. **We now recommend
you submit your application AS SOON AS POSSIBLE**. 

If you are planning to put in an application, we strongly recommend you reach
out to Faculty Research Ethics Administrator, Marc Moyce at
[marc.moyce@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:marc.moyce@bristol.ac.uk), to get advice on your application - ideally in TB1.
