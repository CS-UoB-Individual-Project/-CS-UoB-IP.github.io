# Teaching Block 1

The **Returners Talks** in Welcome Week (Thursday 12th September:  Maths & CS BSc and MEng 13:00-14:00; CS BEng and MEng 14:00-15:00) will include the official introduction to the project.  

In Week 2 we will have a Q&A session, where you can ask questions.  If you have questions before then, you can ask them in the [Projects Yeam Q&A Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A6dad55759f244b258c80536771ee9401%40thread.tacv2/Project%20Q%20and%20A?groupId=2afc7cab-8743-48ed-aaaa-b0d542d2bb68&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b) or add them to the first Q&A Padlet.  

The main focus for TB1 is to choose a project that you wish to
complete in TB2 and a supervisor to help you with it.

## Finding a Project

We will release a **spreadsheet** containing a list of supervisors with projects that they are interested in supervising. **This is a non-exhaustive list**, but a starting point to generate ideas.  If you're interested in any of the projects, email the supervisors to set up a meeting to see if you want to work together.  

We will hold a **project matching session** in Week 4, where you can talk and discuss potential projects with your supervisor.

If you have ideas about the kinds of project you want to do, or supervisors you want to work with, you can approach potential supervisors from the start of TB1, but most students wait until the spreadsheet of projects is released.

It is a good idea to think about the type, area, and potential supervisors beforehand to guide your choices.
Some prompts that might help you:

* What areas/units have you most enjoyed during your time in university?
* What units did you do well in?
* What lecturer(s) would you like to work with?
* Are there areas in Computer Science that you haven't worked on but want to?

There may be some reasons why a project isn't in your best interest to work on, which is worth discussing with your supervisor beforehand:

* The project requires pre-requisite units that you have not completed.
* The project is unusually difficult and your academic track record is not good enough to achieve the mark you desire.
* The project is unusually easy and your academic track record is good enough that a more challenging project would get you a higher mark.
* The project is not within the supervisor's area of expertise so they won't be able to provide the best support.
* The supervisor believes the project you want to work on is not feasible/has too much scope to fit within an individual project.

## Types of Projects

We see a veriety of different proejct ideas, there is never a 'normal' project as these are unique and individualistic.
However, we see that projects tend to fit into one or more of the following four areas:

* **Enterprise**: Aims to develop and/or evaluate a product or service for a specific end user category.
* **Research**: Aims to make a scientific contribution to the body of Computer Science knowledge.
* **Theory**: Aims to make a contribution to a theoretical (usually mathematical) area of Computer Science.
* **Development**: Aims to test the student's ability as a software developer and the project could be added to their portfolio afterwards.

Note that Enterprise, Research, and Theory projects are considered equally challenging: they require aim to improve on something that is already 'out there'.
On the other hand, Development projects are focused purely on ability to code up a solution.
Because of this, development projects are more suited towards students on the BSc than those on the MEng and/or those *not* aiming for a first class mark on their project.
This is not to say that a development project cannot achieve a first class mark, just that there will need to be significant technical challenges to overcome, excellent write-up, or other exemplary areas of the project.

When choosing a project, it is best to talk with your (potential) supervisor over the type(s) of project you are interested in and what you want to focus on.

## Role of the Supervisor

Your supervisor will support and guide your Project, and mark it at the end, along with your second marker. Think of the supervisor as a 'critical friend' who wants you to do well and will support you, but who knows your project is your responsibility. They will not do any work for you, or tell you exactly what you should do, but they may have expectations about seeing things like your project plan, dissertation structure and writing. 

Supervisors will meet you for either half an hour a week or an hour a fortnight during TB2 term time.  It will be your responsibility to set up  and attend the meetings, and if you don't attend the meetings, your supervisor may not chase you up. You will be expected to come to the meetings bringing work and ideas for them to see, and to be proactive about telling the supervisor what you want from them.  

Supervisors will read and give you feedback on 2-3 pages of your draft dissertation, if you arrange this in advance and agree when you will give them the draft and how you will get the feedback. 

Apart from the regular meetings and giving you feedback on your draft, all student-supervisor relationships are very different, as they are personality dependent.  Some students want a hands-off supervisor, who will wait for the student to approach them withe questions, while others want regular contact and clear expectations.  

Some of the supervisors on the list will have already taught you, but most of them won't have.  Don't be afraid to approach supervisors you don't know yet, because they might have exactly the skills/interests you are looking for.  

## Help choosing a Project or Supervisor

If you're not sure what kind of Project to choose, reach out to your personal tutor as soon as possible.  

If you still need help after talking to your tutor, [contact Mike and Sarah](/contact/).


## Confirming a Project

You need to confirm your project by  **the end of Friday Week 5 (18th October)**. This will involve agreeing a project name and rough description of the project with a supervisor and submitting this in a form. The title and description can change before the start of TB2, but you will not be able to change your supervisor unless there is a serious issue - if that happens, please [contact Mike and Sarah](/contact/).

You will also have to have passed the [ethics quiz](/ethics/#ethics-quiz) before you can confirm a project.  The ethics quiz is on the front page of your Unit Blackboard.
