# Teaching Block 1

During teaching block 1 we will hold online Q&As where you can ask questions
regarding how to complete this unit. We will create and advertise padlets to
ask questions. The main focus for TB1 is to choose a project that you wish to
complete in TB2 and a supervisor to help you with it.

## Finding a Project

Supervisors will release a spreadsheet containing a list of projects that they are interested in supervising. **This is a non-exhaustive list**, but a starting point to generate ideas.

We will additionally hold a **project matching session** where you can talk and discuss potential projects with your supervisor.

You are free to try and find supervisors from the start of TB1, but most students wait until the spreadsheet of projects is released.
It is a good idea beforehand to think about the type, area, and potential supervisors beforehand to guide your choices.
Some prompts that might help you:

* What areas/units have you most enjoyed during your time in university?
* What units did you do well in?
* What lecturer(s) would you like to work with?
* Are there areas in Computer Science that you haven't worked on but want to?

There may be some reasons why a project isn't in your best interest to work on, which is worth discussing with your supervisor beforehand:

* The project requires pre-requisite units that you have not completed.
* The project is unusually difficult and your academic track record is not good enough to achieve the mark you desire.
* The project is unusually easy and your academic track record is good enough that a more challenging project would get you a higher mark.
* The project is not within the supervisor's area of expertise so they won't be able to provide the best support.
* The supervisor believes the project you want to work on is not feasible/has too much scope to fit within an individual project.

## Types of Projects

We see a veriety of different proejct ideas, there is never a 'normal' project as these are unique and individualistic.
However, we see that projects tend to fit into one or more of the following four areas:

* **Enterprise**: Aims to develop and/or evaluate a product or service for a specific end user category.
* **Research**: Aims to make a scientific contribution to the body of Computer Science knowledge.
* **Theory**: Aims to make a contribution to a theoretical (usually mathematical) area of Computer Science.
* **Development**: Aims to test the student's ability as a software developer and the project could be added to their portfolio afterwards.

Note that Enterprise, Research, and Theory projects are considered equally challenging: they require aim to improve on something that is already 'out there'.
On the other hand, development projects are focused purely on ability to code up a solution.
Because of this, development projects are more suited towards students on the BSc than those on the MEng and/or those *not* aiming for a first class mark on their project.
This is not to say that a development project cannot achieve a first class mark, just that there will need to be significant technical challenges to overcome, excellent write-up, or other exemplary areas of the project.

When choosing a project, it is best to talk with your (potential) supervisor over the type(s) of project you are interested in and what you want to focus on.



## Confirming a Project

We will need you to confirm a project on **week 8 of TB1**. This will involve agreeing with a supervisor a project name and rough description of the project. You will also have to have passed the [ethics quiz](/ethics/#ethics-quiz) before you can confirm a project.  The ethics quiz is on the front page of your Unit Blackboard.
